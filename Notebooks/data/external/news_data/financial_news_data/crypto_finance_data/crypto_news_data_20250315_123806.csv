The US dollar has long reigned as the world’s primary reserve currency and the default choice for global trade and international transactions. But its dominance is now facing growing scrutiny as shifting geopolitical and economic forces—and concerns over the potential weaponization of the greenback—push more countries to accelerate efforts to loosen their dependence on the dollar. By almost every measure, the US dollar’s command of the global economy is staggering. Although the country accounts for roughly 25% of global GDP, its currency reigns over nearly  60% of global foreign exchange reserves—far outpacing its nearest rival, the euro. But this dominance is increasingly under pressure, with the strategic use of economic sanctions in the past leading some countries to seek alternatives, even as US President Donald Trump regularl...",,Cryptocurrency,0,Neutral,"dollar,global,bitcoin,digital,stablecoins,currency,reserves,countries,trade,international","Trump (ORG),the World Gold Council (ORG),the International Monetary Fund (ORG),Brandon Mintz (PERSON),Andrew Peel (PERSON),Cornell University (ORG),Mintz (PERSON),International Monetary Fund (ORG),Bitcoin (PERSON),Donald Trump (PERSON),Digital Asset Markets (ORG),Russia (GPE),Cointelegraph (ORG),Eswar Prasad (ORG),El Salvador (GPE),the country´s central bank years ago (ORG),Morgan Stanley’s (ORG),Nasdaq (ORG),US (GPE),World Gold Council (ORG),Bitcoin Depot (ORG)",0.060719461697722577,0.30404881350533525,0.42857142857142855,https://cointelegraph.com/news/growth-in-bitcoin-and-stablecoin-adoption-could-accelerate-dedollarization?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

In a March 14 notice, the US Justice Department said Sfraga was sentenced in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) for wire fraud following a May 2024 guilty plea.

In the first three months of his presidency, Donald Trump has ignited trade tensions by announcing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and the result has been unexpected turmoil in US and global markets. The fallout from the tariffs has been relatively swift, and the impact has been felt across the crypto market. As of March 8, the US president had backed away from some plans to impose tariffs on certain Mexican and Canadian goods—another twist in the rollercoaster of US trade policy that continues to shake markets. Singapore crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a note. “This week’s crypto markets have been nothing short of a roller coaster.

According to a translated version of the announcement, the regulations impose “obligations regarding registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, money laundering prevention, and risk disclosure” on VASPs operating in the country.

Bolivia’s state-owned energy firm YPFB is planning to use cryptocurrency to pay for energy imports, according to a March 13 report from Reuters. The move comes as the South American nation faces a shortage of foreign currency reserves and a dwindling supply of domestic gas production. A spokesperson for YPFB said that a system had been put in place to use cryptocurrency to purchase energy imports after the government approved the use of digital assets to meet the country’s demand. While YPFB has not used the system yet, it plans to do so. The report does not reveal what cryptocurrency will be used for the payments.

Bitcoin (BTC) has risen back above the 200-day simple moving average ($83,754), indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The failure of the bears to capitalize on the drop below the 200-day SMA shows that selling dries up at lower levels. However, Bitcoin may not be out of the woods yet. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in a video posted to X that Bitcoin needs a weekly close above $89,000 to confirm a bottom. A move above $89,000 could liquidate roughly $1.60 billion in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. If that does not happen, Hyland warns that Bitcoin will fall into the $74,000 to $69,000 range. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Buyers have a challenging task ahead of them.

Crypto analyst David (@david_dogecoin) suggests that, if confirmed, Dogecoin could be targeting an ambitious price target of $4. The first stage of this pattern, the cup, began taking shape when Dogecoin initially declined from its May 2021 all time high at $0.74. This downward movement led to an extended consolidation period, where the asset gradually formed a rounded bottom in the $0.05–$0.06 range. The curvature of the price action suggests a slow but steady shift in market sentiment, where selling pressure was gradually absorbed by buyers accumulating DOGE at lower levels. As time progressed, Dogecoin started to recover from this bottom, pushing back towards its December 2024 high at $0.48.

The “Ascending Channel” here refers to a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation towards a net upside between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is drawn by connecting successive higher highs. Similarly, the lower one joins higher lows.

Monitoring the movements of the meme coin, analysts believe it has hit a turning point and might thus launch a quick comeback. The question at hand is whether Dogecoin can seize this opportunity and emerge from its decline, as key indicators are currently displaying bullish signals. Some analysts contend that Dogecoin has already reached its lowest price point, which could potentially lead to a rebound. A prominent crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that DOGE has been adhering to a long-term price channel. The overall pattern indicates that a bottom has likely formed, despite the fact that it has momentarily moved outside the channel’s boundary. #Dogecoin has been fol...",DOGE,Meme Coin,0,Neutral,"dogecoin,has,price,doge,its,channel,been,might,meme,analysts","DOGE (ORG),Securities and Exchange Commission (ORG),Trader Tardigrade (PERSON),Dogecoin (PERSON),Gemini Imagen (ORG),TradingView (ORG),leo (PERSON),Dogecoin (ORG),Macro Channel (ORG),TD Sequential (ORG),ullamcorper eu (PERSON),Doge (PERSON),nec (ORG),Deviations (ORG)",0.08802083333333334,0.47343749999999996,0.5,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-recovery-in-sight-key-metrics-predict-a-strong-bounce/

The broader crypto market remains under stress, with fear dominating sentiment and keeping ETH from regaining momentum. The downturn is largely driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade war fears, which have shaken both crypto and the U.S. stock markets. As investors brace for further volatility, some fear that the market is setting up for a deeper correction. However, not all analysts are bearish. Some believe that a recovery could be on the horizon in the coming months, especially if technical indicators begin to show strength.

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. An Argentine prosecutor has requested a judge to issue an Interpol “Red Notice” for Hayden Davis, an American citizen allegedly involved in the launch of the controversial LIBRA memecoin that has entangled Argentine President Javier Milei in a dramatic political scandal. The request, made by prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, reviewed by Fortune, accuses Davis of being a key figure behind the LIBRA memecoin. The token gained significant attention after President Milei endorsed it on Valentine’s Day. Following Milei’s endorsement, LIBRA’s market capitalization soared to over $4.5 billion. However, its value quickly collapsed, plummeting by more than 99% to approximately $18 million.

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Early in 2025, there was a significant surge in the stablecoin market, with a $20 billion increase in total supply. With a 10% increase from January, the total supply now stands at almost $205 billion. The spike, according to data from Glassnode, comes after a dip in late 2024, when the supply of stablecoins fell from $187 billion to $185 billion. For trading cryptocurrencies, stablecoins—like USDT and USDC—often act as a reserve for investors expecting the right time to buy assets like Bitcoin. The most recent rise shows that investor interest has surged, especially in view of last year’s slow down. Since Jan 1, the aggregate #stablecoin supply has increased by $20.17B (+10.9%), now reaching more than $205B.
